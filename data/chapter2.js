                                "At its most compelling, aging science would enable full health extension, so that the function of all organs would be rejuvenated somewhat simultaneously (just as the decline of our organs is somewhat simultaneous). This, however, is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. And if one organ among all others should be prioritized for rejuvenation, it’s the brain. How do we rejuvenate the brain? Probably not by waiting until it has noticeably failed.",

                                "Alzheimer’s research receives nearly $4 billion dollars annually from the United States government alone. Yet the existing focus on narrow approaches to the individual diseases of brain aging (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) has so far resulted in treatments whose risk-benefit profile remains discouraging. Research in this important area has traditionally neglected the root cause of most neurodegenerative diseases: namely, normal aging. Today, only 8% of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) budget is devoted to the biology of aging. Neurodegenerative diseases receive nearly 8 times more funding than fundamental research on aging biology. Yet brain function declines steadily with normal aging, with visible declines in cognitive performance at age 50. Therapeutics must be developed which prevent not just abnormal aging, but also this predictable decline. ",

                                "Though a distinction is often made between “healthy” brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, the boundary between normal and abnormal neurodegeneration is blurred. At age 65, “less than 5% of the population has a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, but this number increases to more than 40% beyond age 85.”  "

                                "Some animals — like songbirds, killifish, axolotls, lampreys, and planaria — naturally regenerate some parts of their brain. Others, like naked-mole rats, appear not to experience any cognitive decline. Animals with superior brain aging profiles remain understudied, and access to non-human primate brain samples, too, remains limited. Catalyzing these efforts isn’t commercially viable in the short term, and this creates a pressing rationale for public and philanthropic funds.",

                                "To simulate the effects of slowing brain aging on the U.S. economy, we assume these investments would pay off primarily by increasing the labor productivity of older workers and, to a lesser extent, decreasing mortality rates with age. We arrive at these values by computing two basic assumptions: that roughly 60% of all labor productivity is brain-related, while roughly 10% of all deaths can be attributed directly to the brain. Hover* Readers are encouraged to input their own assumptions on the role of brain aging in mortality, productivity, and even fertility rates.  (There is an unclear, but increasingly studied relationship between reproductive and brain aging, since the brain helps regulate fertility hormones.) ",

                                "The attentive reader may notice that beyond a certain point, improvements in physical health or other non-cognitive functions have diminishing returns on productivity. A 1-year shift backwards in brain aging adds nearly as much to GDP as a 1-year shift in general biological aging in the near term, because returns from improving the aging profile of other organs (e.g. kidneys or ovaries) are not immediate, and sometimes even reduce GDP temporarily. Improving the cognitive healthspan translates into significant and immediate productivity gains. (+$1080 in GDP per capita terms."

                            "Evolution optimizes for reproductive health, when possible. From this, it follows that menopause is a relative rarity in the animal kingdom. Animals that experience no decline in fertility throughout their lives — like the naked-mole rat — are on one extreme end of the spectrum. Homo Sapiens is on the other extreme end. By some measures, humans are one of only five species in the animal kingdom who undergo menopause. American Lobsters, for instance, become stronger and more fertile with age, and not seldom live to be 100 in good overall health. Most non-human primates also continue to reproduce well into advanced age. In humans, however, the ovaries are the first organ to age — and men’s reproductive healthspan, too, declines more quickly than most assume. This short fertility window (pictured on the right for women) is responsible for several physical and mental health issues. In smaller part, it also contributes to the emerging shortage of working-age adults worldwide. ",

                            "Not all couples would choose to have children in their 40s if they could healthily do so. Yet at least 11% of females seek fertility treatments at some point in their lives, mostly due to age-related infertility.  In Australia, for instance, assisted reproductive technologies have so far been documented to increase total birth rates by 5% — a small but meaningful amount.",

                            "This research area would do more than just increase birth rates. The health and social costs of ovarian aging are impossible to simulate fully in dollars, but even a narrow measure of its effects on GDP produce staggering results. It’s well established that women who undergo menopause later live longer and suffer from fewer age-related diseases like dementia and osteoporosis. It’s no wonder, as reproductive aging scientist Jennifer Garrison notes, that today, when young women — typically under 40 — are diagnosed with menopause, “the medical community treats [it] as incredibly serious.” Yet the predictable decline of ovarian function with age (which coincides with a number of deadly diseases) after age 50 is understood as natural, inevitable, and not in need of treatment."

                            "Given the currently short human healthspan, undergoing a geriatric pregnancy — understood as any pregnancy above age 34.3 for women — is both costly and dangerous. We do not yet understand what causes the female fertility window to last roughly 30 years less than the male window; why the reproductive span correlates with lifespan; or how aging ovaries or testes influence overall aging. What is certain — given precedents in animal models like American lobsters — is that a short fertility window is not a prerequisite for late-life health.",

                            "Therapies which extend the reproductive healthspan could positively affect the health profile of older adults, and over several decades, increase the number of working-age adults at any given time. Little data exists on the relationship between reproductive aging and productivity. It’s possible that the major gains from improving reproductive aging may come not from increased fertility rates, but from the overall  healthspan gains accompanying delays in menopause and the prevention of age-related miscarriages and maternal mortality rates. This would mean increases in GDP per capita as well. Still, our baseline assumptions show that even modest increases in fertility rates — on the order of about 1% — can produce extraordinary effects in the long run.",

                            "The births enabled by a 1-year shift in fertility rates with no improvements in productivity or mortality rates  would detract roughly $3 billion per year from GDP in the near term. This is  because newborns don’t work and because pregnancy and parenthood temporarily translate into lower labor supply. But for our baseline simulation, we consider small improvements in mortality and productivity rates, and arrive at a +$11 billion yearly gain to GDP in the short term. (+0.07 cents in GDP per capita terms.) Compared to investments in brain aging, where the average near-term return is $364 billion per year, investments in reproductive aging are roughly 30 times less valuable in the near term. In the long run, however, the returns from this research area are extraordinary, and can benefit existing humans by increasing the odds of new Einsteins or Karikos.",

                            "The decline of organ function is a common symptom of aging, and many people need their organs replaced as they age. In the near future, it’s unlikely that a single therapeutic will slow down the biological age of all organs, cells, and tissues in the human body at once. Instead, a combination of biotechnologies will likely be needed. And the good news is that the commercial incentives for replacement are somewhat aligned to social needs: there is no shortage of companies attempting to engineer organs, cells, or tissues. CAR-T cell therapies, for instance, are a form of immune system replacement; organ transplants are a way of replacing malfunctioning parts; and hormone-replacement therapies (like insulin) are often used to treat late-stage diseases.",

                            "In a future where the horrific organ shortages of today can be overcome, seemingly healthy patients, having accumulated non-trivial age-related molecular damage, may begin to have their cells and tissues gradually replaced if the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks. Replacing different body parts — large and small — is not just safely done within the context of today’s medicine; it may be necessary to holistically improve human aging in the coming decade."
